# CS-350

Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
  These prokjects focused on utilizing user interfaces in conjuction with information output and remote information through the serial port. Using low level hardware coponents like AHT20 sensor, LEDs, buttons, and LCD screen I was able to successfully create a thermostat.

What did you do particularly well?
  One thing I felt like I did well was translate the user/system requirements into the proper behaviors, especially with the use and understanding of the states of the machine. The state machine method helped make the code more modular and understandble as different states meant certain behaviors and actions would occure.

Where could you improve?
  I think a way to improve my could more would be to implement code in sections at a time. I think if I were to work on each state on its own and get each one implemented properly one at a time it would help my coding efficiency.

What tools and/or resources are you adding to your support network?
  One resource that I enjoyed using for the majority of this class is the gpiozero doc page (https://gpiozero.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#). It helped tremendously in learning functions/methods and properly debugging. 

What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects and/or course work?
  The project helped me learn more transferrable skills for programming state machine designs, real-time data hadnling, as well as integrating peripheals and I/O devices. All crucial skills in IoT applications.

How did you make this project maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
  I amke it maintanable, readable, and adaptable by using clearly names functions and commenting wherever necessary to explain logic and reasoning.
